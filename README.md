# DOSKEY_Manager

DOSKEY_Manager is an app for managing aliases in CMD / New Windows Terminal.

# Setup
Just run setup.cmd and it will localize the app's path to your current directory.
You can always re-run it if you want to move to another directory.

# Features
+ Adds an ever changing customizable background when using the Windows Terminal. The installation directory contains a 'backgrounds' folder in which you can add / remove any backgrounds (both images and gifs) as you want.
+ Automatic backup to the Windows Terminal settings.json when changing a background.
+ Adds a customizable welcome text when opening the terminal. The installation directory contains a 'welcomeScreens' folder with some premade texts. The only text file read is welcome.txt located in the root directory.
+ Enables you to easily add any and as many aliases to scripts or commands of whatever nature you want. Some default ones have been provided.
