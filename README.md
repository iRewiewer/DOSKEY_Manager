# DOSKEY_Manager

DOSKEY_Manager is an app for managing aliases in CMD / New Windows Terminal.

# Setup
Just run setup.cmd and it will localize the app's path to your current directory.
You can always re-run it if you want to move to another directory.

# Customization
You can add any and as many aliases to scripts of whatever nature as you want.
Some default ones have been provided.
The script will automatically detect if you have notepad++ and use it instead of the classic notepad.
